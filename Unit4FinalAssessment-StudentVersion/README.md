# Rubber Duck

How to get the value of the stepper in each custom table view cell and put them together into one "setting" object? Where to host it?

How to interpolate the stepper sender values into the animation functions? fromValue, toValue

How to play all the animations at the same time as one Setting? GroupAnimation...


## Confusion

Not sure if I was supposed to make a View for the Settings Page, because the scaffolding was all in the SettingsViewController, so I just made a SettingsTableViewCell.
